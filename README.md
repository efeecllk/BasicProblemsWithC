//Hi guys,

//These projects include simple projects I did while improving myself and simple projects given at school. 

//You can understand the problem by reading the code.

//The purpose of doing this is to help beginners make it easy to find examples to do.

//I'm new to coding, I'll upload my basic codes here as I improve myself.

//Happy coding.
